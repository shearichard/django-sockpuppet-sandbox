# Strange name of views module
Temporarily I have renamed `views.py` to `viewsNOTTHEDIRECTORY.py` to avoid imports getting confused because there is also a directory called 'views'. 

This clearly isn't a very clean way to do things but I'm just leaving it like that until I've worked out whether other things I'm trying will work and if
so I'll sort out the problem of the multiple uses of 'view'.
